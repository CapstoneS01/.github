# SkyHunt

Whether it be from being too adventurous while hiking, running away from a terrible situation, or due to mental illness, it is estimated that roughly 70,000 people are reported missing in Canada every year. These disappearances dramatically impact the lives of the families, friends, and community that these people end up leaving behind. While searching techniques have gotten better with the advancements of technology, they are still constrained by the physical limitations of the people leading the search. To overcome these limitations, the capstone project our team proposes is an autonomous search drone that is able to locate and identify specific individuals.
